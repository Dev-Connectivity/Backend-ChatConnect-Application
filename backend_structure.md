# Backend Folder Structure

This repository contains the backend code for the Chat Connect Application. Below is the folder structure and a brief description of each folder and file:

## Folder Structure

- config/
  - database.js
  - server.js
- controllers/
  - authController.js
  - userController.js
  - chatController.js
- middlewares/
  - authMiddleware.js
- models/
  - User.js
  - Chat.js
  - Message.js
- routes/
  - authRoutes.js
  - userRoutes.js
  - chatRoutes.js
- services/
  - authService.js
  - userService.js
  - chatService.js
- utils/
  - errorHandler.js
- app.js
- server.js



## Description

- `config/`: This folder contains the configuration files for the application, such as the database configuration (`database.js`) and server configuration (`server.js`).

- `controllers/`: The `controllers` folder houses the business logic of the application. Each controller file corresponds to a specific set of API endpoints. For example, `authController.js` handles authentication-related functionality, `userController.js` handles user-related functionality, and `chatController.js` handles chat-related functionality.

- `middlewares/`: The `middlewares` folder contains middleware functions used to intercept and process requests before they reach the controllers. For instance, `authMiddleware.js` implements authentication middleware for validating user tokens or session information.

- `models/`: In the `models` folder, you will find the data models for the application. These models represent the structure of the database tables or collections. Examples include `User.js`, `Chat.js`, and `Message.js`, which define the schemas and behavior of the corresponding entities.

- `routes/`: The `routes` folder includes route files that define the API endpoints and map them to the corresponding controller functions. For instance, `authRoutes.js` contains the routes related to authentication, `userRoutes.js` contains the routes for user management, and `chatRoutes.js` contains the routes for handling chat functionality.

- `services/`: The `services` folder contains service modules that handle the application's business logic. These services provide an abstraction layer between the controllers and the underlying data operations. Examples include `authService.js`, which encapsulates authentication-related operations, `userService.js`, which handles user-related operations, and `chatService.js`, which manages chat-related operations.

- `utils/`: The `utils` folder houses utility functions or helper modules used throughout the application. For example, `errorHandler.js` provides functions for handling and formatting errors in a consistent manner.

- `app.js`: The `app.js` file sets up the Express application and configures middleware. It defines the core functionality, such as initializing the Express app, connecting to the database, and registering middleware.

- `server.js`: The `server.js` file initializes and starts the server. It creates an HTTP server instance and listens for incoming requests on a specified port.

This folder structure follows a modular and organized approach to building the backend of the Chat Connect Application. Each folder and file has a specific purpose and contributes to the overall functionality of the application. The separation of concerns enables easy maintenance, scalability, and code reusability.

Feel free to customize the folder structure based on your project's specific needs and add additional folders or files as required.
